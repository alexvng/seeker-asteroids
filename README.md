# seeker-destruct

View the project at https://alexvng.github.io/seeker-asteroids/.

A project made for AME 230 at ASU.

Blue seekers will chase the nearest asteroid that isn't already being targeted.

Pink seekers are out of options, and will act as boids instead.

When an asteroid is struck, it will decay into 2-4 new seekers.
